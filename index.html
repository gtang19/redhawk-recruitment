                <h1>What "type" of club is Redhawk Ventures</h1>
                <p>Redhawk Ventures is a club that focuses on professional development and experiental learning, while
                    fostering an ambitious environment. Investment analysts on the fund conduct diligence on and talk to
                    real startups, and real founders.</p>
                <p>At Redhawk Ventures, we teach new members everything they need to know about venture in their first
                    semester on the club, through a comprehensive new member education. After that, everything learned
                    is learning by doing.</p>
                <p>Venture capital is a human focused industry. As a result, it's important for us to maintain an
                    atmosphere that promotes the development of emotional intellegence skills. While Redhawk Ventures is
                    not a "social" club, a strong sense of comradery is developed through the work we do.</p>
